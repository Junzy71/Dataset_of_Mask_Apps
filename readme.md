The folder mask_apps containing the metadata for the labeled Mask Apps.
The folder benign_apps containing the metadata for the labeled benign apps.

The folder unlabeled_apps containing the metadata for the all unlabeled apps.

The folder ipa_samples containing the ipa file (decrypted) for some Mask Apps.

Due to github's file size limitation, unlabeled user reviews data (a file more than 500M) and some ipa files (too many files with average size 50M) can't be uploaded, if you need it, please contact us.
